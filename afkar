Sure, I can help you with the explanation for each question. Here's an explanation idea for the first question:

Question: What does 1 + 1 equal to?
Explanation: In the world of computers, the representation of numbers is different from what we're used to in our everyday lives. Instead of having numbers from 0 to 9, computers use a binary system that consists of only two digits: 0 and 1. In this system, 1 + 1 equals 10, which may seem counterintuitive at first. However, in binary, the digit 10 represents the number two. So, when we add 1 and 1 together in the computer world, the result is 10.

You can use a similar approach to provide unique explanations for each question, relating them to concepts in the computer or coding world.




In the world of computers, any thing is represented using a system called binary, 
which consists of only two digits: 0 and 1. 
Computers understand these two digits as the building blocks of all numbers and calculations. 
Let's explore how binary addition works.
