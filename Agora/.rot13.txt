Imagine you have a secret code that can make your messages look like a jumbled mess!
Well, that's what ROT13 does.
It's a special code that takes each letter in your message and replaces it with another letter from the alphabet.
But it's not just any replacementâ€”it's a secret pattern that goes 13 letters ahead.
Let's say you team name : 'NACIRI BENSAGHIR' After applying the rot13, it becomes: 'ANPVEV ORAFNTUVE'.
Cool, right? It's like having your very own secret language to share fun messages with your friends!
